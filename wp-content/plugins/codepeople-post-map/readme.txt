== Description ==

Post Map features:

	► Deal with large volumes of dots or markers

**CodePeople Post Map** allows to insert a Google Map in a post or in any of the WordPress templates that display multiple posts.

The map inserted in a single post displays a marker at the position indicated by the geolocation information pertaining to the post, but also shows markers of the last posts published in related categories. The number of markers to display can be set in the plugin's settings.

The map inserted into a template displaying multiple posts will contain as many markers as posts making up the page with the associated geolocation info. When the mouse is hovered over the marker, the post to which it belongs gets highlighted.  

**CodePeople Post Map** has a wide range of settings to make your maps more versatile and adaptable.

== Installation ==

**To install CodePeople Post Map, follow these steps:**

1.	Download and unzip the plugin
2.	Upload the entire codepeople-post-map/ directory to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
3.	Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress

== Interface ==

**CodePeople Post Map** offers several setting options and is highly flexible. Options can be set up in the Settings page (and will become the **default setup** for all maps added to posts in the future), or may be **specific to each post** to be associated with the map (in this case the values are entered in the editing screen of the post in question.)

The settings are divided into two main groups, those belonging to the map and those belonging to the geolocation point.

**Map configuration options:**

*   Map zoom: initial map zoom.
*   Map width: Width of the map.
*   Map height: Height of the map.
*   Map margin: Margin of the map.
*   Map type: Select one of the possible types of maps to load (roadmap, satellite, terrain, hybrid).
*   Map language: a large number of languages is available to be used on maps, select the one that matches your blog's language.
*   Display map in post / page: When the map is inserted in a post you can select whether to display the map or display an icon, which displays the map, when pressed (if the map is inserted into a template that allows multiple posts, this option does not apply)
*   Options: This setting allows you to select which map controls should be available.
*   Enter the number of points on the post / page map: When the map is inserted into a post, points that belong to the same categories will be shown on the same map. This option allows you to set the number of points to be shown. When the map is inserted into a template that allows multiple posts this option does not apply.
*   Highlight post when mouse hovers over related point on map:  When the map is inserted into a template that allows multiple posts,  hovering the mouse over one of the points will highlight the associated post through assignment of a class in the next setup option. 
*   Highlight class: Name of the class to be assigned to a post to highlight when the mouse is hovered over the point associated with that post on the map.

**Configuration options related to the location points**

*   Location name: Name of the place you are indicating on the map, alternatively, the name of the post can be used.
*   Location description: Description of the place you are showing on the map. If left blank, the post summary will be used.
*   Select an image from media library: Select an image to associate with the localization point.
*   Address: Physical address of the geolocation point.
*   Latitude: Latitude of the geolocation point.
*   Longitude: Longitude of the geolocation point.
*   Verify: This button allows you to check the accuracy of the geolocation point address by updating the latitude and longitude where necessary.
*   Select the marker by clicking on the images: Select the bookmark icon to show on the map.
*   Insert the map tag: Inserts a shortcode in the content of the post where the map is displayed with the features selected in the setup. You can attach geolocation information to a post but choose not to show a map in the content of the post. In case you do want to display a map in the post content, use this button.
